# Proxy: `POST /v1/chat/completions`

The OpenAI-compatible inference entry point. Point any OpenAI-compatible client at orla and add a stage header.

## Wire shape

Request: standard OpenAI chat completion plus identity metadata. See [`concepts.md`](concepts.md#identity-tags) for the full tag list.

Response: standard OpenAI chat completion. The response's `model` field reports the **resolved backend name**, not necessarily what the client sent in its `model` field. Divergence is by design under the developer and platform engineer split documented in [`concepts.md`](concepts.md).

Streaming follows OpenAI's data-only SSE format, terminated by `data: [DONE]`.

## Request handling order

The handler runs these checks in order. Each is a 400 unless noted.

1. **Decode body.** Body too large, over 10 MB, returns 400.
2. **`messages` non-empty.**
3. **Stage extracted.** From `X-Orla-Stage` header, falling back to `metadata.orla.stage` in the body. Missing returns 400.
4. **Resolve backend.** `registry.GetOrCreate(stage)` auto-creates a default stage record on first sighting. If `stage.Backend` is set, use it. If not, fall back to `req.Model`. If neither is set, return 400.
5. **Apply inference policy** from the stage record. Currently just `reasoning_effort`.
6. **Convert messages and tools** to the internal model types.
7. **Dispatch** via `LayerExecute`, then `BackendManager.ScheduleChat`, into the per-backend queue and a worker that calls the openai-go provider.
8. **Encode response** as OpenAI chat completion or stream chunks.

## Auto-create on first sighting

If a developer uses a stage id that orla has never seen, the daemon inserts a default stage record with no backend and the request falls back to `req.Model` for that one call. The platform engineer can later `PUT /api/v1/stages/{id}` to map it.

This means a developer can deploy new agent code without coordinating with the platform engineer. Their requests still flow, and the mapper picks them up on the next pass.

## Identity tags become completion-record dimensions

Every dispatched request results in one row in `completion_records` with the following columns:

- `completion_id`: UUID assigned by orla
- `stage_id`: from the request
- `workflow_run`: from the request, nullable
- `backend`: the resolved name
- `tags_json`: the full `X-Orla-Tag-*` map
- `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `latency_ms`, `cost_usd`, `status`, `created_at`

This is the mapper's primary observation channel. See [`storage.md`](storage.md).

## Streaming semantics

For `stream: true`:

- Orla opens an upstream stream and proxies chunks. Each chunk is rewritten to include the resolved backend in the `model` field.
- The worker holds its concurrency slot until the upstream stream finishes draining, not just until the first chunk arrives. This is load-bearing for the `max_concurrency` invariant.
- On client disconnect, orla drains the upstream stream silently and the worker releases its slot.

## Error shape

All non-200 responses use the OpenAI error envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "...",
    "type": "invalid_request_error" | "permission_denied" | "rate_limit_exceeded" | "server_error" | "api_error"
  }
}
```

Status code drives the `type` field. Clients that already handle OpenAI errors handle these correctly.
